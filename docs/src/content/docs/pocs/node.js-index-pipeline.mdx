title: Node.js Index Pipeline to bring own FS
description: Bring your own FS Directory without data transformation to serve content addressable data
---

Infra deployment PoC for an Index Pipeline for retroactive content addressability on existing data to be served via Hash Stream.

Repository: [vasco-santos/hash-stream-index-pipeline-server-poc](https://github.com/vasco-santos/hash-stream-index-pipeline-server-poc)

## Introduction

This PoC setup relies on the following Index, Pack and FIle stores in a S3 compatible bucket:

- [`@hash-stream/index/store/fs`](https://github.com/vasco-santos/hash-stream/blob/main/packages/index/src/store/fs.js)
- [`@hash-stream/pack/store/fs`](https://github.com/vasco-santos/hash-stream/blob/main/packages/pack/src/store/fs.js)
- [`@hash-stream/index-pipeline/file-store/fs`](https://github.com/vasco-santos/hash-stream/blob/main/packages/index-pipeline/src/file-store/fs.js)
