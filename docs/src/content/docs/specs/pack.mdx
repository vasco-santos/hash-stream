# Abstract

This document describes the Pack Reader, responsible for interacting with a Pack Store to read Packs of part of them.

## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

# Overview

Hash-stream relies on Packs for both storing Content-Addressable data and transferring it across the network in a verifiable manner. A Pack is a container that holds a collection of byte streams. This specification defines the **Reader** interface, which enable interaction with other Hash-stream building blocks.

A **Pack** contains multiple **Blobs**, each addressed by a unique multihash. A **Pack** itself is also addressable via a multihash, meaning it can be treated as a **Blob**. Multiple **Packs** MAY also store the same **Blob**. A **Blob** is a sequence of bytes that can be stored individually or within a **Pack**.

## Design Principles

- **Trustless verification**: Ensures clients can independently verify retrieved content.
- **Efficient storage access**: Optimized for cost-effective and rapid data retrieval.

## Interfaces

### Verifiable Entry Interface

A verifiable entry where bytes MUST match the multihash. It may optionally include

```ts
import { MultihashDigest } from 'multiformats'

export interface VerifiableEntry {
  bytes: Uint8Array
  multihash: MultihashDigest
  offset?: number
  length?: number
}
```

### Pack Reader Interface

```ts
import { MultihashDigest } from 'multiformats'

export interface PackReader {
  storeReader: PackStoreReader

  // Retrieves bytes of a pack file by its multihash digest.
  get(hash: MultihashDigest): Promise<Uint8Array | null>

  // Stream data from a Pack, optionally requesting specific byte ranges.
  stream(
    targetMultihash: MultihashDigest,
    ranges?: Array<{
      offset?: number
      length?: number
      multihash: MultihashDigest
    }>
  ): AsyncIterable<VerifiableEntry>
}

export interface PackStoreReader {
  // Retrieves bytes of a pack file by its multihash digest.
  get(hash: MultihashDigest): Promise<Uint8Array | null>

  // Stream data from a Pack, optionally requesting specific byte ranges.
  stream(
    targetMultihash: MultihashDigest,
    ranges?: Array<{
      offset?: number
      length?: number
      multihash: MultihashDigest
    }>
  ): AsyncIterable<VerifiableEntry>
}
```
