description: Learn how to install and use the hash-stream libraries.
---

This repository provides a set of libraries and tools that allow you to build and run a trustless HTTP server for content-addressable data. These building blocks are modular and designed in a plug-and-play fashion, enabling you to use just a subset of them to create a custom server. Going through the [Blueprint](/hash-stream/intro/blueprint) document is a great way to better understand Hashstream.

For those interested in implementing building blocks differently, there are a few [specifications](/hash-stream/specs) and interfaces available, allowing new implementations to be compatible with the existing pieces.

Documentation can be seen at [https://vasco-santos.github.io/hash-stream](https://vasco-santos.github.io/hash-stream):

## Development

### Installing

To work on this codebase **you need**:

- Node.js >= v18
- Install the deps with `pnpm i`

### Testing

For testing environment, first install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/) and ensure it is running. This codebase has `S3 client compatible` backed datastores used in testing, which are simulated using Docker.

Next, ensure the `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables are set in your terminal. They do
not need to be set to real values - the following works in `bash`-like shells:

```
export AWS_REGION='us-west-2'; export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='NOSUCH'; export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='NOSUCH'
```

## Packages

The repository includes the following packages:

- [`packages/cli`](./packages/cli/): A CLI tool for transforming data into content-addressable data, writing index records, and a verifiable streamer.
- [`packages/streamer`](./packages/streamer/): A library for streaming verifiable data associated with a requested multihash, based on available index records and stored packs.
- [`packages/index`](./packages/index/): A library with implementations for `IndexReader` and various `IndexWriter` strategies, along with `IndexStore` implementations.
- [`packages/pack`](./packages/pack/): A library for writing data into packs (`PackWriter`) and reading them back (`PackReader`), facilitating the creation and retrieval of content-addressable data. While writing data into packs, Index Records can be created when provided an `IndexWriter` implementation.
- [`packages/utils`](./packages/utils/): Utility functions for working with [hash-stream](https://github.com/vasco-santos/hash-stream), including converting verifiable blob streams to CAR files or raw bytes and building HTTP responses with appropriate content headers.
